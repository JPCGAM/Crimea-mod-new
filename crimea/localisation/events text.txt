event three:
title: ""
description: ""Wow, how are we here?! And what is this place?!"- One of them called Dave says. "I have no idea but it seems kind of poggers."- Another one called Dan says. "Hey, its JPGSP, he is a pony unlike us 5 which are humans."- Oleg says. "Technichally I am in Serova's body, but I am JPGSP."- JPGSP says. "This looks like some kind of bedroom, oh and Giannis is here, surelly you are going to speak, right?"-Edis says. "Well, I have no other choice."- Giannis answers.\n "So, I have a bit of an idea to do mean while, what if we have an orgy?"- Someone there says.\n \n "Oh really? What the hell would that be about?"- Oleg asks. "We can't just have an orgy, we need to find out who is behind all this!"\n The rest of them are kind of ok, and when Oleg sees all of this he decides its fine but JPGSP, being his OC which is a pony and female decides to stay out of this.\n "Wait, so you want us all to just have a bunch of random sexual encounters? What kind of game are we going to find ourselves in?"- JPGSP asks.\n "Stop being so puritan, if you were up to it, you would be having one with me right now."- Oleg says and looks at her with a wink.\n "Eh, how would you even have sex with a pony, and honestly this whole thing makes me want to puke, il just stay away inside the room doing other things."- JPGSP says.\n "Bye JPGSP I trust you."- Oleg says and kisses her cheek.\n "What the hell man, I might be in a female pony body but I'm male in realisty!!"- JPGS says and tries to punch Oleg, he blocks her punch and almost takes a swing at her, but then he stops himself and backs off.\n "Just get on with the orgy, I need to learn some spell to get this off my memory."- JPGSP says again.\n The orgy is quite obvious in the conversation and a terrible idea, but you can't really find much to do there, so you just listen.\n The other five get in the bed and start having penetrative sexual contact with each other.\n JPGSP casually reads a book while he has some ear plugs to stop hearing what is happening, the problem is that its earpulgs design for humans but he is in a pony body.\n As the noises begin, he begins to get sick to his stomach.\n "You really shouldn't be doing this."- JPGSP thinks.\n Oleg and the rest of them ignore him, they even generate moans so JPGSP realizes he should probably start recording everything, he takes out his phone and begins taking notes. Then he feels a bit more better when he notices that the orgy is starting to get interesting.\n "Hey..."- Oleg says and looks at him. "You don't like watching orgy do you?"\n "I feel like puking..."\n "In fact I might make a magical bubble to stop the noise coming."- JPGSP says flaying to another side of the room with his wings and then using his horn to make the bubble, just in case.\n Once again, the spell is designed to stop sounds, not let them through, but it's the best he can do.\n "Are you ok, being here?"- Oleg asks.\n "I nedd to puke..."- JPGSP says and leave the room.\n Although he leaves the room he keeps the phone recording, he then comes back and sees that the orgy is starting to get interesting.\n He can see there is a lot of back and forth.\n Each one of them is putting their penis in the others ass forming a circle, JPGSP finds this very disgusting.\n One of them, then starts moaning, more specifically whispering some sort of older language.\n His eyes widen and then groan, understanding the words, he realizes what the circle they are in means.\n Basically, they are giving themselves the curse of slavery.\n Dan says: "Imbecile, the circle is for imbeciles."\n JPGSP realizes that he said it out loud and tries to stop himself from saying it again.\n Oleg looks at him and then laughs.\n "Please don't tell me you're actually scared of a circle."- Oleg says.\n And then Giannis says: "You're not the boss of me."\n Oleg tries to stop himself from laughing again and then continues.\n "Please, no one is here to arrest you you know, its just one big orgy."\n Edis then starts whispering in another language, and then he does that thing where he bites his wrist and bleeds on the persons face.\n This causes all of them to laugh incredibly hard as they attempt to "imitate" the man.\n Dave confused and ammused says: "What the hell does this have to do with anything?"\n They ignore him and continue.\n Eventually, after quite some time one of the men in the circle grabs JPGSP.\n "Why hello there, my man. It appears that you are about to make history."- Oleg says."
response: "I wonder where this leads"

description: "\n He then forces JPGSP to have sexual contact with all of them, they laugh the whole time.\n "That was amazing."- Oleg says. "I can finally say I've been in a circle."\n "Bruh, you just fucked a grey pastle horse, how does that make you feel?"- JPGSP says creeped out from what Oleg did.\n "It doesn't matter, it still counts."- Oleg says and attempts to kiss JPGSP.\n JPGSP pushes him away.\n "What the hell, man?"- Oleg says.\n "You thought this would be a one shot deal, but now you realize that making history means more contact, right?"\n Oleg nods.\n "Thats it, I'm making an impasable bubble, now none of you can touch me"- JPGSP says as he makes a bubble and goes up into the ceeling, hoping that they can't easily get in that way...\n Unfortunately they find a way.\n As JPGSP hides in the ceiling, he hears the orgy is still going on.\n "For CELESTIAS SAKE, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH?!"- JPGSP says, annoyed.\n "As soon as one of you is able to give me an answer."- Oleg says.\n JPGSP hears footsteps approaching and then...\n "HEY, YOU COWARDLY SOUL DAMAGING THINGS!"- JPGSP shouts as he appears from the ceiling, surprising Oleg and the others in the room.\n Oleg gets up and punches JPGSP, it's a pretty hard hit to the jaw.\n "YOU MISERABLE BASTARD!"- Oleg shouts and then starts kicking JPGSP.\n You can't do anything as JPGSP attempts to defend himself, but it doesn't take long for the fight to end.\n As JPGSP uses his magic and knocks out Oleg\n "Please just finish, I want to delete all of this from our memory."- JPGSP says finishing reading the spell.\n "Alright."- Edis says as he slaps the unconscious Oleg on the back.\n "You know, you look kind of good as a female alicorn with a dress on."- Oleg laughs.\n JPGSP then hovers over Oleg's face and gives him a serious look, which scares him a bit.\n "Do not speak of me or my abilities in a manner that I have not sanctioned, understand?"- JPGSP says extending his wings as a sign of higher position.\n "Yes, yes, yes!"- Oleg submits and JPGSP lets him go.\n Dave says to Dan: "I've always wondered what it would be like if Oleg was a woman."\n To which Dan replies: "Oh my god, I can't even..."\n Eddis joins in and says: "Yeah, so has everyone. I mean it would be pretty creepy if you think about it."\n Giannis then says: "Yeah, but he'd totally be hotter as a woman."\n "Yeah, that's not the point, Eddis!"- Dan says.\n "My point is, why take a man that is kind of creepy as a woman that is creepy too?"- Eddis replies.\n "Why did you not make him a cat or something?"- Dan asks.\n "So funny listening to you wonder that, meanwhile I can here just turn anyone into anything, alicorns are indead the supperior race..."- JPGSP says in a bored tone.\n "Hey, I'm an alicorn!"- JPGSP says as he turns into a bottle of wine and hovers in the air.\n "Hey, now that's not fair!"- JPGSP says as she turns into a glass of beer.\n "Hey, I'm not drinking this!"- Dan says trying to save the bottle of wine.\n "I don't really give a flying rat-" Oleg starts to say.\n "Shut up Oleg!"- Dan says, continuing: " About the process of being turned into a human or whatever this is."\n "Yes?"- JPGSP asks nervously.\n "Well...What's stopping me from just trying to transform myself now?"- Dan asks.\n "I don't know Dan, why would there be anything stopping you?"- Eddis asks.\n "I just want to be safe."- Dan says.\n "From what?"- JPGSP asks.\n "You...You just seem really powerful, from what I've heard."- Dan says.\n "Do you know something that I don't?"- JPGSP asks.\n "No, I just.."- Dan starts to say before Eddis interrupts.\n Dave says: "I'll say he's powerful, look at him he turned himself into a sparkling!!"-\n "Dave!"- Eddis says.\n "What?! It's a fact!!"- Dave says.\n "Dave, shut up!!"- Eddis says.\n "Either way, I want to be safe."- Dan says.\n "bruh, lets just go home" Oleg says.\n "Alright..."- JPGSP says as he turns to the door and open it. "But never speak of this again" he says.\n "I won't."- Dan says. "Thanks for the help."\n "Alright, let's go home."- Oleg says.\n Then all 6 leave the room and magically the leaders of the country and the old room are back snd they proccede with the diplomatoc meeting."
